    "## Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables in Python allow us to store information and give it a label that we can use to retrieve that information later. We can use variables to store numbers, strings (a sequence of characters), or even more complex data types like lists and dictionaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "We assign values to variables by putting the value to the right of an equal sign.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because Python is a dynamic language, we don’t need to declare the type of the variables before we store data in them.\n",
    "\n",
    "That means that this is valid Python code:\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> x = 42\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike typed languages, the type of what’s contained in Python variables can change at any time.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the below is perfectly valid Python code:\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> x = 42\n",
    ">>> x = \"hello\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the value of the variable x changed from a number to a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "When creating variables, there are a few best practices you should follow.\n",
    "Naming Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Convention says that variables should be named in lowercase, with whole words separated by underscores.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to learn more about Python naming conventions look at PEP8 during a break.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because Python is a dynamic language and you don’t have type hints to explain what’s stored inside a variable while reading code, you should do your best naming your variables to describe what is stored inside of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s ok to be verbose. For example, n is a poor variable name, while numbers is a better one. If you’re storing a collection of items, name your variable as a plural.\n",
    "\n",
    "Learn more about great naming practices for dynamic types by watching this 30-minute talk by Brandon Rhodes.\n",
    "Naming Gotchas\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some things that you can’t name your variables, such as and, if, True, or False. That’s because Python uses these names for program control structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can’t start your variable name with a digit, although your variable name can end in a digit. Your variable name can’t contain special characters, such as !, @, #, $, % and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "💣 Python will let you override built-in methods and types without a warning so don’t name your Python variables things like list, str, or int.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you notice your program behaving oddly and you can’t find the source of the bug, double check the list of built-in functions and built-in types to make sure that your variable names don’t conflict.\n"

    "\n",
    "There are three different types of numbers in Python: int for Integer, Float, and Complex.\n",

    "x = 42j\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, Integers and other simple data types are just objects under the hood. That means that you can create new ones by calling methods. You can provide either a number, or a string. This will come in handy later on in the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "x = int(4)\n",
    "y = int('4')\n",
    "z = float(5.0)\n",

    "## Mathematical Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "Numbers can be added together. If you add a float and an int, the resulting type will be a float.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you divide two ints (integers), the result will be of type float.\n",
    "## Boolean Types\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, Booleans are of type bool. Surprisingly, the boolean types True and False are also numbers under the hood.\n",
    "\n",
    "    True is 1 under the hood.\n",
    "    False is 0 under the hood.\n",
    "\n",
    "That means you can do silly things, like add two Boolean numbers together, but I’ll cover why this is a useful Python feature later in the course."
