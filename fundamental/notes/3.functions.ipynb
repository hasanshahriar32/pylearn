    "# Functions\n",
    "Defining Functions\n",
    "The purpose of functions in Python are to create reusable code. If we find ourselves copying and pasting the same code multiple times, that’s a good sign that a function might help!\n",
    "\n",
    "Anatomy of a function\n",
    "This is the recipe for defining a Python function:\n",
    "\n",
    "def: the def keyword, telling Python we’re about to start a function definition\n",
    "a name for the function\n",
    "(: opening parenthesis\n",
    "(optional) the names of one or more arguments, separated with ,\n",
    "(optional) the names and values of one or more default arguments, separated with (,) note: we’ll see these in the next section\n",
    ") closing parenthesis\n",
    ": a colon\n",
    "A function in Python is defined with the def keyword, followed by the function names, zero or more argument names contained in parenthesis (), and a colon : to indicate the start of the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The contents of the function then follow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, an optional return statement can follow, if the function plans on passing data back to the caller.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# A Basic Function that accepts no arguments and returns nothing.\n",
    "def hello_world():\n",
    "    print(\"Hello, World!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# A Function that accepts two arguments, and returns the value of\n",
    "# those numbers added together.\n",
    "def add_numbers(x, y):\n",
    "    return x + y\n",
    "```\n",
    "If you forget the recipe while trying to create a function, Python will help you remember with a SyntaxError.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, trying to create a function without the colon ::\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> def hello_world()\n",
    "```\n",
    "  File \"<stdin>\", line 1\n",
    "    def hello_world()\n",
    "                    ^\n",
    "SyntaxError: invalid syntax\n",
    "And trying to create a function without the parenthesis ():\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> def hello_world:\n",
    "```\n",
    "  File \"<stdin>\", line 1\n",
    "    def hello_world:\n",
    "                   ^\n",
    "SyntaxError: invalid syntax\n",
    "Function Contents\n",
    "The recipe for function contents:\n",
    "\n",
    "a new line\n",
    "indentation (press tab on your keyboard)\n",
    "one or more lines\n",
    "(optional) a return statement\n",
    "return statement\n",
    "A return statement is a way to “short-circuit” the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a return statement, you can optionally pass back data to the caller of your function.\n",
    "\n",
    "with no return statement\n",
    "If a function doesn’t have a return statement, it implicitly returns None.\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> def foo():\n",
    "```\n",
    "...     x = 5\n",
    "...\n",
    ">>> val = foo()\n",
    ">>> type(val)\n",
    "<type 'NoneType'>\n",
    "with a return statement, but no value\n",
    "If a function has a return statement, but no value, it also returns None. This is typically used to control the flow of a program.\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> def foo():\n",
    "...     x = 5\n",
    "...     return\n",
    "...\n",
    ">>> val = foo()\n",
    ">>> type(val)\n",
    "```\n",
    "<type 'NoneType'>\n",
    "with a return statement and a value\n",
    "To return a value from a function, just type it after the return statement. You can return anything from a Python function, including other functions! For today, we’ll focus on simple and complex data types.\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> def foo():\n",
    "...     x = 5\n",
    "...     return x\n",
    "...\n",
    ">>> val = foo()\n",
    ">>> val\n",
    "```\n",
    "5\n",
    "As we explore simple functions, our return statements will usually be at the end of the function, but that’s not the only way they can be used. A function can have multiple return statements, and those return statements can be used to help control the flow of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Because it’s syntactically correct to have multiple return statements in a function, it’s up to you to use them correctly. If you use a linter for your code files and you place additional code in a function after a return statement, the linter will give you a helpful hint about the rest of the code being unreachable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indentation\n",
    "One of the most important aspects of functions is indentation. Remember, Python doesn’t use curly braces to figure out what’s inside a function like other languages you’ve seen like JavaScript or Java.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python knows what code is related to a function by how it’s indented. Anything that’s indented one level deep under the function declaration is part of the function, no matter how many spaces there are between lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "To add a level of indentation, just press the Tab key on your keyboard after entering a new line.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you’re using the REPL, once you’re done entering your function, you’ll need to press enter an additional time, to mark the end of the function. You know you’re done defining your function when you see the 3 input arrows >>> again.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s try it together. Type the following code in your REPL. Note that the 3 dots ‘…’ indicate that those lines are indented in the REPL. If you type your code in a Python file, you won’t see the ... dots.\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> def add_numbers(x, y):\n",
    "...     return x + y\n",
    "...\n",
    " See an error? Expand this section.\n",
    "Calling Functions\n",
    "With no arguments\n",
    "Once you’ve defined a function, you can call it from your Python code as many times as you’d like.\n",
    "\n",
    "To call a Python function, type in it’s name, along with parenthesis, and any required arguments to the function. Let’s try it now, with a function that doesn’t require arguments.\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> def hello_world():\n",
    "...     print(\"Hello, World!\")\n",
    "...\n",
    ">>> hello_world()\n",
    "Hello, World!\n",
    "With arguments\n",
    "Let’s try it again, this time with a function that does accept arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, note that the function accepts names for the arguments. But, when we call the function, we’re passing in values.\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> def add_numbers(x, y):\n",
    "...     return x + y\n",
    "...\n",
    ">>> add_numbers(3, 5)\n",
    "8\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "Storing the returned value of a function.\n",
    "Storing the returned value of a function is easy. All you need to do is assign it to a variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s try it now.\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> def add_numbers(x, y):\n",
    "...     return x + y\n",
    "...\n",
    ">>> new_number = add_numbers(3, 5)\n",
    ">>> new_number\n",
    "8\n",
    "The variable new_number now contains the result of running our add_numbers function with our arguments 3 and 5."
